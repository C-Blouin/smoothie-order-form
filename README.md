# JavaScript Smoothie Ordering Form

A simple JavaScript project that takes user-inputted form data and displays the smoothie order details to the browser based on chosen values. This project provided a fundamental understanding of capturing specific pieces of data to allow for manipulation and correct output. This project was developed during my second semester at Georgian College through a JavaScript fundamentals course.
